Velocity as chance to move?

Todo list:
Use fish schooling parameters, either surface sheet, dome or ball formation parameters

Sharks slower than fish - DONE

Stochastic effects (direction preference, shark slower than tuna) - DONE

Obstacles - DONE?

Vary parameters through time (vision at night / day) - DONE (more possible)

Fish get assigned a different sets of parameters

Rejected ideas:
Water velocity (preferred direction based on position on grid)
What parameters model different school types
