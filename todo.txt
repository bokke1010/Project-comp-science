Velocity as chance to move?

Consider:
Sharks slower than fish - DONE

Stochastic effects (direction preference, shark slower than tuna) - DONE

Obstacles - In progress
Water velocity (preferred direction based on position on grid)

Fish get assigned a different sets of parameters

Vary parameters through time (vision at night / day)

What parameters model different school types
